### 1.2. Description of the Current System and Its Problems
The current database system allows students and tutors to connect for tutoring in educational institutions, but it still faces several challenges:

- **Appointment Scheduling:** Scheduling tutoring sessions is messy, making it difficult for students and tutors to find suitable times without accidentally booking the same slot, causing confusion and frustration.
- **Communication Challenges:** Communication between students and tutors is scattered, making it difficult to organize sessions effectively. Timely updates or changes often donâ€™t reach everyone on time, impacting the reliability of the system.
- **Resource Sharing Limitations:** Accessing study materials is challenging due to the lack of a central platform for sharing resources, complicating collaborative learning opportunities for both students and tutors.

TutorConnect aims to create a user-friendly space that fosters collaboration and enriches the overall learning experience. The platform is designed to simplify appointment scheduling, improve communication, and enhance resource sharing between students and tutors.
